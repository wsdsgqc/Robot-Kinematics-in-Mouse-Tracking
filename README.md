# Robot-Kinematics-in-Mouse-Tracking
This is for robot kinematics learing in Python.
Use Mouse click to get its position in XY coordinates and You should input your link length of your robot links thourgh VScode Terminal. Inverse kinematics used here to caculate the joint angle of links in Geometry method. Than Use Forward Kinematics to caculate the position of final point that you click and draw it.
